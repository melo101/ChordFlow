Please don't take him just because you can
[Verse]
.Am                    C
You could have your choice of men
.    G              Am
But I could never love again

And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
.  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
