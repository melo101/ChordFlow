        <h2>About ChordFlow</h2>
        <p>ChordFlow is a free and ad-free application created by an amateur musician who needed a quick and simple way to view chord progressions without lyrics. Over time, the app evolved to also support full lyrics with integrated chords, aiming to serve a broader audience — from rehearsals to live performances.</p>
        <p>As it is developed by just one person, the app may still have some limitations or minor bugs. There are other apps on the market with more advanced features, but they can also be more complex and less practical on stage. ChordFlow aims to be a lightweight, intuitive and essential solution.</p>
        <p>The Android version is optimized for stage use, rehearsals or studio sessions, presenting chords and sections clearly and accessibly.</p>
        <p>The Windows version was designed as a creation and editing assistant — ideal for comfortably preparing your setlists on a computer before your concerts. You can organize songs, edit chords and structure sections easily, and then export to the Android app for real use on stage.</p>
        <h3>Why the Windows version was created</h3>
        <p>Creating long setlists on a phone or tablet can be slow and impractical — especially with dozens of songs. The Windows version of ChordFlow was created to solve this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit songs and chords more quickly and comfortably</li>
            <li>Organize setlists using your mouse and keyboard</li>
            <li>Export easily to the Android app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This way, you prepare everything on your PC and take only the essentials to the stage.</p>
        <h3>Purpose Summary:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and edit musical setlists with organized sections</li>
            <li>Manage chords and song structure</li>
            <li>Use the Windows version as a support tool</li>
            <li>Use the Android version for live consultation on stage or rehearsal</li>
        </ul>
