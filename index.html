    <h1>ChordFlow Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective date: May 4, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for choosing ChordFlow. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our application.</p>
    <p>ChordFlow was developed as a free and ad-free application. Our policy is to respect your privacy and keep your use of the application as safe as possible.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The ChordFlow application does not collect or transmit any personal data from users to remote servers. All data created during the use of the application (such as setlists, songs, and settings) are stored only locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Locally Stored Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Setlists and songs created by the user</li>
        <li>Display preferences and application settings</li>
        <li>Usage statistics (stored locally only)</li>
        <li>Supporter name (optional, only if you make a contribution)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is never transmitted to the internet and is under your complete control. You can delete it at any time by uninstalling the application or using your device's data clearing functions.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>ChordFlow offers optional in-app purchases as a way to support development. When making a purchase:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The transaction is processed by Google Play, not by our application</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your payment data or financial information</li>
        <li>We only store locally the name you choose to provide (optional) for acknowledgment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Since the application does not collect personal data on remote servers, there are no risks associated with data breaches in our systems.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. We recommend that you review this policy regularly for any changes.</p>
