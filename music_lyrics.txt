[Verse 1]
.        Bm                    F#
On a dark desert highway
.       A                       E
Cool wind in my hair
.     G                   D
Warm smell of colitas
.     Em                         F#
Rising up through the air

.     Bm                           F#
Up ahead in the distance
.      A                        E
I saw a shimmering light
.    G                                   D
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
. Em                        F#
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
.    Bm                        F#
There she stood in the doorway
.  A                        E
I heard the mission bell
.    G                                                  D
And I was thinking to myself
.            Em                                     F#
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell

.     Bm                           F#
Then she lit up a candle
.    A                              E
And she showed me the way
.    G                                      D
There were voices down the corridor
.     Em                          F#
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus]
.     G                                D

Plenty of room at the Hotel California
.    Em                                                                          F#

[Verse 1]
.     F#m
She was more like a beauty queen
.           G#dim7
From a movie scene
.        A
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean
.           G#dim7
I am the one
.          F#m
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"

.     F#m
She said I am the one
.           G#dim7
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Verse 2]
.     F#m
She told me her name was Billie Jean
.         G#dim7
As she caused a scene
.         A
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
.          G#dim7
Of being the one
.          F#m
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
.     Dmaj7
People always told me
.     C#7
Be careful what you do
.     Dmaj7
Don't go around breaking
.        C#7
Young girls' hearts

[Chorus]
.     F#m
Billie Jean is not my lover
.     Dmaj7
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
.     C#7
But the kid is not my son

Stand By Me (A)
Ben E. King

[Intro]
.A  F#m  D  E

[Verse 1]
.        A              F#m
When the night has come
.        D              E
And the land is dark
.        A              F#m
And the moon is the only light we'll see

[Verse 2]
.        A              F#m
No, I won't be afraid
.        D              E
Oh, I won't be afraid
.        A              F#m
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
.        D              E
So darling, darling
.        A              F#m
Stand by me, oh stand by me
.        D              E
Oh stand, stand by me
.        A
Stand by me

[Verse 3]
.        A              F#m
If the sky that we look upon
.        D              E
Should tumble and fall
.        A              F#m
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea

[Verse 4]
.        A              F#m
I won't cry, I won't cry
.        D              E
No, I won't shed a tear
.        A              F#m
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
.        D              E
And darling, darling
.        A              F#m
Stand by me, oh stand by me
.        D              E
Oh stand, stand by me
.        A
Stand by me
